## If you are interested, here is a snapshot of my experience:

Over several years, my career as a data scientist and data analyst has centered on using advanced data techniques and analyses across different industries. My main goal has been to help teams use data to improve user experiences and drive business growth. I've also been hands-on in setting up systems to handle data smoothly and provide the right information to the right people. I've worked across various areas, from tech services to startups delivering products and providing insights to marketing teams.

During this time, I've actively contributed to several impactful projects, showcasing my skills in different scenarios:

* By applying Natural Language Processing, I managed the classification of product use cases, enabling insightful analysis
* I devised an effective scoring system to categorize products based on synchronous and asynchronous behaviors, streamlining product development 
* I utilized analytical skills to identify frontend and backend events linked to suboptimal FPS performance, leading to targeted improvements 
* I led the creation of a predictive churn model, which assesses customer behavior to predict potential churn instances, allowing for proactive strategies
* I analyzed Net Promoter Score (NPS), uncovering key insights to enhance customer satisfaction strategies 
* I conducted comprehensive feature analysis, both during beta testing and post-launch stages, providing valuable insights into user adoption patterns 
* I automated delivery processes using Natural Language Processing and transfer learning, resulting in an innovative book recommendation system that leverages Google Books metadata, user profiles, purchase history, and reviews 
* I designed a robust classification model for digital news, aligning personalization and retention strategies for user-centric web pages 
* I applied user segmentation techniques, incorporating behavioral variables and data from diverse sources, to improve the public transportation experience
* I performed thorough analyses of customer data, order histories, and operational aspects, identifying trends and driving product improvement initiatives
